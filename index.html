            <h2>Who are the South Elgin Patriots?</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in 2002, the Patriots Youth Football League is a volunteer, non-profit franchise and a proud member of the historic <a href="http://bgyfl.org/" title="bill george football league"  target="_blank">Bill George Youth Football League</a> founded by <a href="http://bgyfl.org/?page_id=1103" title="" target="_blank">Bill Pope in 1963</a>. We are a travel league that plays <a href="http://bgyfl.org/?page_id=8" title="13 communities"  target="_blank">13 communities</a> around the Chicagoland area. Our football organization offers opportunities for young athletes from kindergarten through grade 8 and cheerleading from grades 2 through 8. Our franchise services the Fox Valley community and has athletes that attend either U-46 or District 303 schools.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              To provide the children, of our area, an opportunity to be involved in a team sport, to provide them with the best possible equipment and facilities, and to teach them sportsmanship, discipline and dedication that will follow them through life while leaving them with an enjoyable and growing experience.
            </p>

            <h2>Why play youth football?</h2>
            <p>
              If you are still reading this, you may be considering placing your child in youth football. You may also have some major reservations. You are probably asking yourself some very difficult questions, and rightfully so. The news, reality TV, social media, publications, etc., saturate our daily lives with stories about how football is an unsafe, violent, and reckless sport. In addition, media tells us that coaches are rigid, negative, and overly-critical idealists. Rarely, do you see the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mich-middle-school-football-team-conspires-for-touching-touchdown/" title="youth football players help disabled boy"  target="_blank">positive impact</a> youth football programs are having in shaping the lives of our young people. These stories are prevalent, but unfortunately many times they serve only as a footnote in your local news.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
              After 20+ years involved in football at the youth, high school, and collegiate level, I find it difficult to imagine how my life may have been different had football not been woven into its very fabric. Football has shaped who I am. It is the reason my wife and I decided to start my 7 year old son on the same journey. Directly, I have learned confidence, self-discipline, determination, teamwork and how to overcome adversity. Indirectly, the friendships that I made in youth football continue to this day. We have been the best man in our weddings and the Godparents to our children. We experienced life together and they are friendships that have endured when others have fallen away. 
            </p>

            <h2>The Patriots believe in Football</h2>
            <p>
              In a culture littered with distractions(video games, etc), football offers life experiences. It's one of the few sports that offer opportunities to youth at every skill level. In turn, much like life, our athletes learn that they all must accept each other's differences and work together towards a common goal. Sound familiar? Furthermore, with advances in technology our children tend to live more sedentary lives. Football and cheer provides a fun, active outlet for your child. As parents, we want to equip our son or daughter with the tools to succeed not just on the field, but in life. In partnership with USA Football, we believe in providing a positive foundation. We believe in football.
            </p>

            <h2>Safety Concerns</h2>
            <p>
              At this point you still probably have deep concerns about your child's safety. The BGYFL and the Patriots are committed to teaching your son in a safe environment. As the modern football player grows in strength and speed, we must adapt with proven research, modern technology and sound technique. That's why we are proud partners with <a href="http://usafootball.com/" title="Proud partners with USA Football" target="_blank">USA Football</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              USA Football is using the knowledge acquired from years of research to revolutionize tackling techniques through its <a href="http://usafootball.com/headsup/" title="Heads Up Football" target="_blank">Heads Up Football<sup>SM</sup></a> program. This new approach (through cooperation with the NFL) changes the culture of America's favorite sport. It's the comprehensive solution to player safety: concussion awareness and management, coaching education, proper equipment fitting and Heads Up Tackling<sup>SM</sup>(as well as a set of recommended standards for parents, coaches and leagues). <sup>&#8224;</sup> In addition, our coaches are also <a href="http://www.ncsisafe.com/" title="NCSIS link" target="_blank">background checked</a> and CPR certified with our on-staff Red Cross certified trainer.

            <h2>Our Coaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
              We take our coaching responsibilities very seriously. Personally, the coaches I had at the youth level were some of the most influential in my life. Sadly, one of them recently had passed away. At his funeral, I stood and watched as wave after wave of former players had stopped by to pay their respects to a man they had not seen in almost 20 years. This is the type of impact coaches can have in a young person's life. The responsibility of nurturing an athlete who learns, grows, and develops over the course of a season is one of the most fulfilling reasons we volunteer. As coaches, we realize that we are looked up to, respected, and held to a higher standard.
            </p> 

            <p>
              Our philosophy is simple. We focus on developing well-rounded young athletes that grow not just as a player but as a person. Academic and personal growth are paramount in the individual development of your child. Our certified coaches provide a positive community where our players can learn football or cheer in a fair, challenging, and fun environment with an unwavering commitment to safety.
